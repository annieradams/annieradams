### What am I up to? 👩🏼‍🎓 🚵🏻‍♀️ 🌎

I am a Lecturer at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management! I specialize in the intersection of environmental science and data science, with expertise in:

- Machine learning applications across diverse environmental domains,
- Data storytelling techniques that translate complex environmental findings into compelling narratives for non-technical audiences, policymakers, and community stakeholders
- Open science advocacy through reproducible workflows, version control, and collaborative coding practices, adapting to evolving data science standards while mentoring students in sustainable research 
  methodologies

My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge data science and pressing environmental challenges. I'm passionate about empowering the next generation of environmental leaders with computational skills while developing innovative solutions to sustainability problems.

In my spare time, I love to bike, hike, and camp! I am so lucky to live on the California Coast, where the sun is always shining (aside from some May gray and June gloom ⛅️). I love to travel abroad and try to visit a National Park in each new country I visit! 

 I could spend an unlimited amount on different data science related passion projects that pique my interest! I am currently working to build an interactive dashboard of my personal Strava data, using the `{strava}` package in R. I would eventually love to do the same with books I have read and am currently reading, using my Goodreads data! My favorite thing about data science is that I can apply it to anything and everything that interests me.
