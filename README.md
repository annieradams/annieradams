### What am I up to? 👩🏼‍🎓 🚵🏻‍♀️ 🌎

I am currently finishing up my master's program and will be graduating in June 2024! I have been learning lots in the areas of machine learning, data visualization, statistics, and environmental modeling! I am extremely motivated by the capabilities of data science and looking forward to doing meaningful work after I graduate! 

In my spare time, I love to bike, hike, and camp! I am so lucky to live on the California Coast, where the sun is always shining (aside from some May gray and June gloom ⛅️). I love to travel abroad and try to visit a National Park in each new country I visit! 

 I could spend an unlimited amount on different data science related passion projects that pique my interest! I am currently working to build an interactive dashboard of my personal Strava data, using the `{strava}` package in R. I would eventually love to do the same with books I have read and am currently reading, using my Goodreads data! My favorite thing about data science is that I can apply it to anything and everything that interests me.
